      <h2>Stuff We’ve Done</h2>
      <h3>The Locker Room Legacy</h3>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://www.lockerroomlegacy.com/" target="_blank">Locker Room Legacy</a> is a unique experience which combines aspects of social media, professional networking, mentoring, and event promotion.  The platform directly benefits school sports programs as well as their current and former athletes.  SlothWerks helped the Locker Room Legacy team with tutorial videos in order to streamline the user experience.
      </p>
      <h3>Kyros Digital</h3>
      <p>
        SlothWerks provides user experience research and product development services to <a href="https://kyrosdigital.com/" target="_blank">Kyros Digital</a>.

      </p>
      <h3>Habitrade</h3>
      <p>
        As a part of Grand Rapids Startup Weekend, SlothWerks provided UX research, UI wireframe design, and user flow expertise to a small team of developers, entrepreneurs, and creatives.  The brief project resulted in an app concept that utilized both monetary and social components to incentivize the user to form good habits and stick to a multi-week “habit campaign”.
      </p>
      <h3>TownFly</h3>
      <p>
        Built in less than two weeks and launched at Start Garden in December 2017, the <a href="https://townfly.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">TownFly</a> web application collected local events from Facebook based on location and other user input.  The app was built by a team of four using the React JavaScript framework with a Node.js backend.  Recent Facebook policy changes, unfortunately, rendered the API inoperative.
